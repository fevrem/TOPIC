## Get Started

Follow these steps to run the 12-DOF spatial biped example:

- Run `TROPIC_add_path()` from the Matlab command line in the main TROPIC directory. 
- Go to `examples/spatial-12-dof-biped/` and open `main.m`
- Run `main.m` (this will overwrite the seed file with the newly optimized gait), or run each section and stop after the animation.


## Requested Features 

- [x] Add humanoid example
